# The Big Book of Small Python Projects

These are my solutions to each of the projects in the book 'The Big Book of Small Python Projects' by Al Sweigart, given each project's briefing and the desired outcome.

## Tools & requirements
- Python 3.1.1+
- Most projects use the Python standard library. A few projects use external library libraries including pyperclip and colorama

## How-to
1. Clone the project: https://github.com/sammclennan/big-book-of-small-python-projects
2. Run any of the scripts: python bagels.py

## Notes
These are my own implementations and may differ from those in the official book. You can find the official resources and book [here](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/)
