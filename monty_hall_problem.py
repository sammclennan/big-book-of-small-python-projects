# The Monty Hall Problem illustrates a surprising fact of probability. The problem is loosely based on the old game show Letâ€™s Make a Deal and its host, Monty Hall. In the Monty Hall Problem, you can pick one of three doors. Behind one door is a prize: a new car. Each of the other two doors opens onto a worthless goat. Say you pick Door #1. Before the door you choose is opened, the host opens another door (either #2 or #3), which leads to a goat. You can choose to either open the door you originally picked or switch to the other unopened door.
